# Problem 6

# Let's get an idea of what an off-the-shelf classifier can give you on this data.
# It's always good to check that there is something to learn, and that it's a problem
# that is not so trivial that a canned solution solves it.
# Train a simple model on this data using 50, 100, 1000 and 5000 training samples.
# Hint: you can use the LogisticRegression model from sklearn.linear_model.

# Optional question: train an off-the-shelf model on all the data!
